### Introduction

**AppleJelly** is a modern headless component library designed to deliver flexible, unstyled UI primitives while prioritizing accessibility and developer experience.
Inspired by DataDog's [DRUIDS](https://druids.datadoghq.com/) architecture, AppleJelly provides robust functionality without imposing styling decisions, allowing developers to implement custom designs effortlessly.

In this storybook page, you'll explore the components of AppleJelly, each of which can be tabulated with the [sb-addon-permutation-table addon][permutation-addon].

### Features

- **Headless Components**  
  Focus on functionality without baked-in styling – bring your own CSS or favorite styling solution.

- **Designed with [Component Driven User Interfaces](https://componentdriven.org)**
  UIs are built from the “bottom up” starting with basic components then progressively combined to assemble screens.

- **DRUIDS-Inspired Architecture**  
  Built with the same modular philosophy as DataDog's DRUIDS, emphasizing clean separation of logic and presentation.

- **Automatic Theme Detection**  
  Components automatically adapt to OS-level light/dark theme preferences via CSS media queries.

- **Accessibility First**  
  Full WAI-ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation support out of the box.

- **Theme Customization** (⛔ Now on working!! )
  Override auto-detected themes using CSS variables or component props for granular control.
